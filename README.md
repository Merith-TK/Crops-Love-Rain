Crops Love Rain makes crops grow faster when it's raining.

## Configuration
### Gamerule

The speed that crops grow at can be changed with the `cropGrowthSpeedDuringRain` gamerule. The default value is 10. A lower value is a faster growth rate, and a higher value is a slower growth rate.

### Disabling
You can disable the effect by setting the `cropGrowthSpeedDuringRain` to 0.
